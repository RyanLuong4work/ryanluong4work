## Featured Projects

### 1. Python - API Scraping and Wrangling - Youtube's API search
- **Description**: his project demonstrates my skills in scraping data using the YouTube API Search, managing API keys and quota limits. After collecting the results in JSON format, I perform data wrangling to clean and transform them into a structured DataFrame.
- **Skills**: Python
- **Key Insights**: Built a Python class to manage API keys, automatically rotating them when a quota limit is reached and pausing until the next quota reset (midnight, Pacific Time). Converted raw JSON results into a clean, structured DataFrame for further analysis.

### 2. Python - Netflix - Content Production Analysis
- **Description**: This project analyzes the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset, focusing on trends in content type, category, ratings, duration, and release patterns across time and countries. The goal is to uncover insights that can help Netflix achieve a more balanced distribution of its content.
- **Skills**: Python
- **Key Insights**: Netflix’s content is dominated by movies (~70%), with TV Shows growing but still smaller in share. Mature-rated content (TV-MA, TV-14) makes up the majority, while kids’ titles are significantly underrepresented (~24%). Movie durations have steadily increased since 2016, suggesting Netflix is focusing on producing more cinematic titles. Content production peaked between 2016–2019 before downturnin 2020. Western and South Asian countries lead production, leaving room for competitors to expand in underrepresented markets like Japan, Spain, and South Korea.
